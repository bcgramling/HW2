			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
			I was born and raised in a small farming town in Illinois. My hometown of Geneseo is close to the Mississippi, 
			and only a 20 minute drive from Davenport, Iowa. I have two younger sisters. Paige, 18, is a freshman at University of Northern Iowa, and Jessa, 10, 
			is in 4th grade. Both of my parents also grew up in Geneseo and are fans of The Iowa Hawkeyes. During the summer I enjoy playing golf and tennis 
			with friends. My other hobbies include playing video games, watching movies, and listening to pod casts. I also have a large collection of comic 
			books,and enjoy finding new stories to add to my collection. 
	
			</P>
			<p>
			
			I am a senior at the University of Iowa. In December, 2017 I earned a B.B.A in Accounting. My hope is to earn a
			second degree in Information Systems to help me earn enough credits to take the CPA exam. My career goal is to 
			work in Accounting Information Systems. For the past 6 years I have worked at Oakwood Country Club in Coal Valley, Illinois. 
			My job included golf related customer service and golf operations management. I enjoyed my time at Oakwood and hope to become a member 
			of the country club once I have a full time career.
