			<h4>About me</h4>
			<p>
			I was born and raised in a small farming town in Illinois. My hometown of Geneseo is close to the Mississippi, 
			and only a 20 minute drive from Davenport, Iowa. For the past 6 years I have worked at Oakwood Country Club in Coal Valley, Illinois.
			My job included golf related customer service and golf operations management. My favorite part of working at Oakwood
			was playing golf for free every Monday. During the summer I enjoy playing golf and tennis with friends. My other hobbies
			include playing video games, watching movies, and listening to pod casts. I also have a large collection of comic books,
			and enjoy finding new stories to add to my collection.

			<p>
			I am a senior at the University of Iowa. In December, 2017 I earned a B.B.A in Accounting. My hope is to earn a
			second degree in Information Systems to help me earn enough credits to take the CPA exam. My career goal is to 
			work in Accounting Information Systems.
